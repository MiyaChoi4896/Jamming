TO DO 
- simulate sending and recieving a message - done
- Simulate jamming with the option to change probabilities - done
- add a gui
- simulate multiple devices - done
- add visuals showing messages being sent and the jamming occuring
- add more options to the jamming probabilities by using different networks
- enable the devices to connect to eachtoher using ack
- while the devices are connected they have the abilitiy to disconnect lets say 1/60 secs


- make the network type simulate how the data gets transmitted
- enable jamming then ask what jamming method to use


thoughts:
having the user select the network type selects hoiw many frequencys the message gets 
transmitted over or the message picks one of x frequencies. spot picks one and jams one
in x messages sent on the frequency
sweep could randomly jam certain letters
barrage just jumbles the letters
